# RISC-V Instruction Formats and Encoding

## Introduction

The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is a highly modular and extensible design that supports multiple instruction formats. These formats are used to represent various operations and their associated operands. Each instruction format has been carefully designed to balance simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency in hardware implementation and software development.

### Key Types of Instruction Formats

1. **R-Type (Register-Register)**:
   - Used for operations that involve only registers.
   - Example: Arithmetic or logical operations such as `add`, `sub`, etc.

2. **I-Type (Immediate)**:
   - Used for instructions that operate on a register and an immediate value.
   - Example: Load instructions such as `lw` or arithmetic operations like `addi`.

3. **S-Type (Store)**:
   - Used for store instructions where data is written to memory.
   - Example: `sw`, `sd`.

4. **B-Type (Branch)**:
   - Used for conditional branch instructions.
   - Example: `beq`, `bne`.

5. **U-Type (Upper Immediate)**:
   - Used for instructions that load a 20-bit immediate value.
   - Example: `lui`, `auipc`.

6. **J-Type (Jump)**:
   - Used for unconditional jump instructions.
   - Example: `jal`.

---

## Importance of Instruction Formats

### 1. **Instruction Decoding**
Instruction formats allow hardware to efficiently decode the binary representation of instructions. By following a standard layout, the control unit can quickly identify the operation (`opcode`), registers (`rd`, `rs1`, `rs2`), and immediate values.

### 2. **Pipelining**
A consistent instruction format simplifies pipelining, where multiple instructions are executed simultaneously at different stages. The fixed width of RISC-V instructions ensures smooth transitions between stages and reduces pipeline hazards.

### 3. **Processor Design**
The compact and uniform instruction formats reduce hardware complexity, enabling simpler and cost-efficient processors. RISC-V’s design philosophy minimizes transistor usage while maintaining high performance.

### 4. **Compiler Design**
Instruction formats play a critical role in optimizing compiler-generated code. The availability of specific formats, such as `I-Type` for immediate values or `B-Type` for branching, ensures that compilers can generate efficient machine code for different tasks.

### 5. **Extensibility**
The modular design of RISC-V allows the addition of custom instruction formats without disrupting existing ones. This makes the ISA future-proof and adaptable for new technologies.

---

## Explanation of Key Components

### 1. **Opcode**
- The `opcode` specifies the operation to be performed. It is a field in every instruction that indicates the instruction type and the operation (e.g., arithmetic, memory access, branching).
- Example:
  - `0110011`: Specifies an `R-Type` operation (arithmetic).

### 2. **funct3 and funct7**
- These fields are used in `R-Type` and some other instructions to further differentiate operations that share the same `opcode`.
- Example:
  - For `add` and `sub`, the `opcode` is the same, but `funct7` distinguishes them:
    - `funct7 = 0000000` → `add`
    - `funct7 = 0100000` → `sub`

### 3. **Immediate Value**
- The `immediate` value is a constant encoded directly in the instruction.
- Immediate values are commonly used for:
  - Memory addresses in load/store instructions.
  - Offsets in branch instructions.
  - Direct arithmetic with constants.

### 4. **Registers (`rd`, `rs1`, `rs2`)**
- Registers are the primary storage locations for data during instruction execution.
  - `rd`: Destination register (where the result is written).
  - `rs1`: Source register 1 (contains the first operand).
  - `rs2`: Source register 2 (contains the second operand, if applicable).

### 5. **Split Immediate**
- Some instruction formats split the immediate value into multiple parts for efficient encoding.
  - Example in `S-Type`:
    - `imm[11:5]`: High bits of the immediate value.
    - `imm[4:0]`: Low bits of the immediate value.

<summary>Task 4: Simulation of RISC-V Core Verilog netlist and testbench. </summary>

   `NOTE: Since the designing of RISCV Architecture and writing it's testbench is not the part of this Research Internship, so we will use the Verilog Code and Testbench of RISCV that 
    has already been designed. The reference GitHub repository is : iiitb_rv32i`


## Objective
The objective of this task is to perform simulation of the RISK-V core using LogNetList and TestBench. The simulation involves compiling the Verilog files, generating a `.vcd` file, and observing the waveform in GTKWave.

---

## Steps to Perform Simulation

### 1. Setting up the Environment
- Ensure you have the following installed:
  - **Icarus Verilog** for compiling and simulating Verilog files.
  - **GTKWave** for waveform analysis.
- Use a Linux-based system or a terminal supporting Verilog tools.

### 2. Create Required Files
- Create the following files:
  1. **LogNetList**: Contains the design implementation in Verilog (e.g., `divya_rv32i.v`).
  2. **TestBench**: A Verilog file to simulate the design (e.g., `divya_rv32i_tb.v`).

### 3. TestBench Requirements
Ensure your testbench includes the following lines to generate a `.vcd` file:
`verilog
initial begin
    $dumpfile("divya_rv32i.vcd");  // Specify the .vcd file name
    $dumpvars(0, <module_name>);  // Replace <module_name> with the top module name
end `

### 4. Compile the Verilog Files
Run the following command in the terminal to compile your Verilog files:
`iverilog -o divya_rv32i divya_rv32i.v divya_rv32i_tb.v`


### 5.Run the Simulation
Execute the following command to simulate the design and generate the .vcd file:
`./divya_rv32i`

### 6. Observe the Waveform in GTKWave
Open the .vcd file in GTKWave using the following command:
`gtkwave divya_rv32i.vcd`

### Instruction 1: `add r6, r1, r2 `

#### **Input:**
- Values: `1` and `2`
#### **Output:**
- Result: `3`
#### **Explanation**:
- r1 = 1
- r2 = 2
- r6 = r1 + r2 = 3

### Insrtuction 2: `sub r7, r1, r2`

#### **Input:**
- Values: `1` and `3`
#### **Output:**
- Result: `FFFFFFFF` (32-bit representation of `-1` in two's complement)
#### **Analysis:**
The output `FFFFFFFF` suggests that the operation performed was a **Subtraction** resulting in a negative value. This matches a **SUB** instruction in your instruction set.

### Instruction 5: `slt r11, r2, r4 `

#### **Input:**
- Values: `4` and `5`
#### **Output:**
- Result: `1`
